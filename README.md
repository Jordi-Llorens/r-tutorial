## Organization of the repository

This repo is structured as follows. First, you will probably care the most about the handouts, you can find these in **handouts** folder. As a rule I will give handout in **pdf** and **html** format - I recommend using html ones, they look nicer. These files are generated (usually) from R, using Rmarkdown package; you can find the source files in the same folder. Source files are usually better if you want to copy-paste some of the code, since these are text-files, without any formatting (unlike pdf or html). There is also **resources** folder where I will be putting useful things related to the classes - snippets of the code, articles etc. 

Lectures are organized in a way so that the most of the time is spent learning-by-doing. Folder **exercises** will contain problems you will focus on during the class.


## Licence 

Finally, all the files you find in this folder comes with a licence. LICENCE file describes in what ways you can use them further down the line, after the classes are over.
